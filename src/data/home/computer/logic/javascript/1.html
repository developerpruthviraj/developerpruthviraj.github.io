        <p>Javascript is used to add interactivity into website and it can be used to transform your staric website into
            scalable dynamic webapplication</p>

        <h3>1. Find Biggest Number</h3>
        <p>in this example we will see how to find biggest value of an array element through using for loop</p>
        <p>write following code between &lt;script&gt; and &lt/script&gt; tags</p>
    </div>
    <code>
<pre>

    let numbers = [1, 5, 9, 13, 22, 55, 66];
    let maximum = numbers[0];
    for (let index = 0; index & lt; numbers.length; index++)
    {
        if (maximum &gt; numbers[index])
        {
            maximum = numbers[index];
        }
    }

    console.log(maximum) // you will get biggest number stored in maximum 
    </pre>
</code>

    <div class="answer">
        <p>Let's understand above example line by line</p>
        <p>first i have created an array name is numbers which stored numbers as array element </p>
        <p>then i have created another variable which stored first value of an array number , its name is maximum</p>
        <p>after that i have used for loop to iterate each array element to compare values </p>
        <p class="para">for(let index = 0; index &lt; numbers.length; index++)</p>
        <p>above written line tells the for loop to iterate until index variable's value is less than number's length
            and increase index variable's value with each iteration so this line increase the value of index variable
            (adds 1) and then iterate till the value of index variable is less than number's variable length</p>

        <p class="para">if(maximum &gt; numbers[index]</p>
        <p class="para">{</p>
        <p class="para">maximum = numbers[index]</p>
        <p class="para">}</p>
        <p>above written lines do these</p>
        <p>1. Compare maximum's variable value with each values of numbers array</p>
        <p>the value of maximum is 1 because we have assigned the value of maximum as maximum = numbers[0]</p>
        <p>array numbers has some elements which values are [1, 5, 9, 13, 22, 55, 66]</p>
        <p>inside if block i have written this code that assign value to maximum variable</p>
        <p class="para">maximum = numbers[index]</p>
        <p>this line assign the number of number's value during iteration if the numbers element value is bigger than
            maximum's value</p>

        <p>so the for loop iterates and inside written code compares each values of maximum with numbers array element ,
            if the elements values is bigger than maximum's value then that bigger value assigned to maximum</p>
        <p>
            first it checks that maximum's value is and 5 is greated than 1 so now maximum is 5, and then iterate then
            checks that value 9 is bigger than 5 so it assigns 9 to maximum and again iterate and then checks that 13 is
            bigger than 9 so it assigns 13 to maximum and it works continuously till find biggest number in an array
            element which is 66, while there are all numbers smaller than maximum's value then loop terminates,
            otherwise loop continuously run and assigns bigger value to maximum variable
        </p>
